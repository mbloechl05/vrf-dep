# GitLab: Vascular risk factors and depressed mood

This gitLab-repro contains analysis codes for the project 'Vascular risk factors and the long-term course of depressed mood'. 

Two datasets were analysed: 

1. Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and the 
2. English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). 

For each dataset, the analysis code is split into different subscripts:

1. Data preprocessing (1_preproc.R)
2. Descriptive statistics (2_descriptives.R)
3. Testing measurement invariance (3_measurementinvar.R)
4. Fitting the growth models (4_growthmodels.R)

All data to run the analyses can be downloaded [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/203)* and [here](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200011), respectively. 

*MIDUS 1: ICPSR 2760, MIDUS 2: ICPSR 4652, MIDUS 3: ICPSR 36346
