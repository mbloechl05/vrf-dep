# Vascular risk factors and depressed mood

This git-lab-repro contains analysis codes for the project "Vascular risk factors and the long-term course of depressed mood". 

Two datasets were analysed: 

1. Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and the 
2. English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). 

For each dataset, the analysis code is split into different subscripts:

1. Data preprocessing (1_preproc.R)
2. Descriptive statistics (2_descriptives.R)
3. Testing measurement invariance (3_measurementinvar.R)
4. Fitting the growth models (4_growthmodels.R)

All data can be downloaded [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/203)* and [here](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200011), respectively.
